## Ticks

<img src="ticks.png" width="800">

* Ticks break up the continuous finite price curve into a curve with evenly spaced discrete points.

* Each discrete point represents a specific price at which trades can occur.

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Current price at tick 1

<img src="ticks-1.png" width="550">

* The gap between two adjacent ticks - for example, from 1 to 2, or from 1 to 0 - is the smallest possible price movement possible for these tokens relative to each other.

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Tick Spacing

<img src="ticks-2.png" width="750">

* The gap between two adjacent ticks - called tick spacing - is the smallest relative price movement possible for a given pair of assets in a pool.

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Ticks <> Prices

<img src="tick-price.png" width="750">

* 1.0001 was chosen because of the fact that the number implies:
  * For each tick, the relative price moves by 0.01%.
</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Price at Tick = 0

```
p(i) = 1.0001 ^ i

i = 0

=> p(i) = 1.0001 ^ 0
		= 1
```
* This implies that 1 unit of Token A = 1 unit of Token B exactly.
* So if the tick is zero, the two tokens trade exactly 1:1 right now.

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Price at Tick = 10

```
p(i) = 1.0001 ^ i

i = 10

=> p(i) = 1.0001 ^ 10
		= 1.0010004501
```
* This implies that 1 unit of Token A = 1.0010004501 units of Token B
* So we get slightly more than 1 unit of Token B for each unit of Token A.
* So a positive tick value means that Token A is worth more than Token B per-unit.

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

* In a specific pool, the current tick is -23421. What is the relative price of Token 0 to Token 1?

  * 1 Token0 = 0.0961 Token1
  * 0.096 Token 0 = 1 Token 1
  * 1 Token0 = 0.961 Token1
  * 1 Token0 = 10.401 Token1

</script></section>

* In a specific pool, the current tick is -23421. What is the relative price of Token 0 to Token 1?

    * 1 Token0 = 0.0961 Token1
    * **0.096 Token 0 = 1 Token 1**
    * 1 Token0 = 0.961 Token1
    * 1 Token0 = 10.401 Token1

</script></section>

## Recap

* Ticks are discrete points on the finite pricing curve, with each point representing a specific relative price at which a trade can happen. 
* Importantly, trades can only happen at these tick values.

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Recap

* The tick spacing - gap between two adjacent ticks - is the smallest possible relative price movement in a given pool. In our above examples we have used a tick spacing of 1, however certain pools may have higher tick spacing than that.

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Recap

* Converting ticks to relative prices by raising to powers of 1.0001 has a nice property that with each singular tick unit the relative price movement is one basis point (or 0.01%).

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Facts

* Since the curve is finite, and that the minimum tick spacing you can have is 1 (given ticks must be integers), there is actually a enforced value of the global `MIN_TICK` and `MAX_TICK` that can possibly exist.

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Facts


* Uniswap v4 stores all tick values in an `int24` data type 
  * Has the range of [-8,388,608, 8,388,607]. 
  * The actual enforced range is [-887,272, 887,272]
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

* If the tick min/max bound was not additionally restricted and was only enforced by the choice of the `int24` data type - what is a possible reason for why a pool could not conduct a swap if tick was actually at the maximum bound?
  * The amount of output tokens is too high - to the point that it is not possible for normal ERC-20 contracts to have that much total supply
  * The math is not mathing anymore at that point
  * The computations involved will break the EVM's gas limit

## Ticks are not enough

* Given a price range, the current price P, and an amount x of asset X - how much of asset Y is required to add liquidity to an X/Y pool to cover the desired price range?
  * A user has x = 2 ETH. They want to create a liquidity position in an ETH/USDC pool. The current price of ETH is P = 2000 USDC. They want to add liquidity in the range of P_a = 1500 to P_b = 2500 USDC. How much USDC do they need?

## Q64.96 Numbers

* Q64.96 numbers are a way of representing rational numbers that uses 64 bits to represent the integer part, and 96 bits to represent the fractional part of the given number.
* A number can be converted between its decimal notation and its Q Notation with a fairly simple equation:

```
Q_n = D_n * (2^k) where k = 96
```

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

* What is the Q Notation value for the Sqrt(P) in a pool where the current tick is 100?
  * ~7.962 * 1028
  * ~7.73 * 1020
  * ~4.12 * 1054
</script></section>

    * ~7.962 * 1028
    * ~7.73 * 1020
    * ~4.12 * 1054

So why have we been talking about Ticks, Square Root Prices, and Q Notation all along?

```
struct SwapParams {
	int24 tickSpacing;
	bool zeroForOne;
	int256 amountSpecified;

	uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96;
}
```
* The price at which their order should be fulfilled
* How much slippage they're willing to accept

## Position rebalance hook

* How much liquidity is available in a given price range?
* How much of y is needed for a given amount of x?
* For these as well, you will be dealing with a combination of Q64.96 numbers, ticks, and P values - and need to be able to convert between the different representations.
